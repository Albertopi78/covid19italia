The project is open in terms of code, data and in terms of approaches to informations and process to collect.

We need the help of active citizens of the world in other to be help people in different countries.

## Are you are interested in development of this project for your country?

You can contribute in different ways:

* Do you have a civic hackers community to develop coding? Ok. You can start to open issues, discuss here and make a part of  job on Github [here](https://github.com/emergenzeHack/covid19italia/issues).

* Do you have other active citizens or associations? Ok. You can also contribute to the translation in your country languages, translate part of the website and then you can pull request in the Github Repo Or you can send your translation with a specific issue [here](https://github.com/emergenzeHack/covid19italia/issues) asking to add the translation.

## How organize your community to crowdsource reports?

In addition to civic hacker community the most important part of the project is composed by a Reports Moderation Team.

You need one Moderation Team active for your country (in order to moderate and verify every report that you receive).
You need a Github Repo to store the reports [like this one](https://github.com/emergenzeHack/covid19italia_segnalazioni/issues) in order to organize reporting with labels and in order to make moderation with your moderation team.
Be sure that you have prepared a list of LABELS to organize your reports in categories (example: request of help, news, fake news etc etc...).
When you are ready with this please open an issue [here](https://github.com/emergenzehack/covid19italia/issues/new?title=%5BNewCountryCollaboration%5D), describing your country and your situation so we can abilitate the possibility to send reporting and collect your data for your country using the same process and platform!

You can also indicate your specific domain in the issue, we try to manage (with CNAME file on Github) the redirect on the right web page.

We will ask you a minimal collaboration to create your report forms and to translate same part of the platform if will necessary and then... you can start!

**From the moment when you will integrate your Moderation Team will be able to see in the Github Reports repo your report, will accept the reports and then the reports will be publish on the website.**

Here a little diagram to explain how the project is organized in multi-country configuration. We wait you! Thanks!
