The project is open in terms of code, data and in terms of approaches to informations and process to collect.

We need the help of active citizens of the world in other to be help people in different countries.

## Are you are interested in development of this project for your country?

You can contribute in different ways:

* Do you have a civic hackers community to develop coding? Ok. You can start to open issues, discuss here and make a part of  job on Github [here](https://github.com/emergenzeHack/covid19italia/issues).

* Do you have other active citizens or associations? Ok. You can also contribute to the translation in your country languages, translate part of the website and then you can pull request in the Github Repo Or you can send your translation with a specific issue [here](https://github.com/emergenzeHack/covid19italia/issues) asking to add the translation.

## How organize your community to crowdsource reports?

In addition to civic hacker community the most important part of the project is composed by a Reports Moderation Team.

You need one Moderation Team active for your country (in order to moderate and verify every report that you receive).

When you are ready with this please open an issue [here](https://github.com/emergenzehack/covid19italia/issues/new?title=%5BNewCountryCollaboration%5D), describing your country and your situation so we can abilitate the possibility to send reporting and collect your data for your country using the same process and platform!

Here the basic step to integrate you in our platform (we can support you in this procedure), you need:

1. At least a [Telegram](https://web.telegram.org/#/login) account to contact us. We will create a Telegram group for coordination.

2. At least a [Github](www.github.com) Account to moderate issues and make modifications to the web platform. We will create a Github editor group for reports management.

3. At least a [Kobo](https://kobo.humanitarianresponse.info/) Toolbox account in order to manage your webforms and translate them. We will share basic form that you have to translate in your language in this way:
- Go into your Kobo Profile and search the web form shared by us.
- Under "Current version" of Web For click on the world icon "Manage Translations"
- Add a "your" language on the Kobo Forms
- Near the desired language, click again the world icon "Update Translations"
- Set "your" language as default
- Re-deploy the form

4. A Github Repo to store the reports [like this one
(https://github.com/emergenzeHack/covid19italia_segnalazioni/issues) is necessary in order to organize reporting with labels and in order to make moderation with your moderation team.

5. A Github Repo to store platform data.

6. A branch of our master platform branch on Github.

7. Be sure that you have a list of LABELS to organize your reports in categories (example: request of help, news, fake news etc etc...).

8. For the domain, we can provide you a web address or you can indicate your specific domain, we try to manage a redirect on the right web page.

**From the moment when you will integrate your Moderation Team will be able to see in the Github Reports repo your report, will accept the reports and then the reports will be publish on the website.**
